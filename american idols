    <h1 style="font-size: 25px;" >Welcome to our American Music Icons website. We are Alessia, Benedetta, Elisa and Riccardo, first year students of the second cycle degree in Language, Society and Communication at the University of Bologna.

    <br>
    <br>When talking about music, many were the topics that came to our minds. Also, the website title “American Music Icons” is very wide and potentially includes a lot of record-breaking performers on the music scene. Among them all, we decided to opt for The Destiny’s Child and Dolly Parton, denoting respectively a girl music group whose success in the hip-hop scene easily spread around the  world, and a Tennessee girl turning her music into the soundtrack of the American country tradition. The project we were able to carry on thanks to the Melody Unibo visualizations and graphics allowed us to bring to life many of the things we wanted to tell about our chosen music icons and also to discover a lot of information we were not aware of. 
    <br>
    <br>If you are interested in knowing more about how we developed our project, what information we focused on and how the Melody graphics look like, we invite you to scroll down this webpage and enjoy our stories.

    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p style="text-align:center ;"></p>
    <p>Our story aims at providing an overview of the amount of girl bands that have populated the music scene since the very beginning of the last century. Girl bands, especially the ones who have their origins in the United States of America, are many and diverse. This is the reason why, after delineating very briefly the amount of girl bands, the number of members they are (and were) composed of, we decided to focus on a particular girl band whose career is marked by an impressive amount of records and hits: The Destiny’s Child.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align:center ;"></p>
    <p>Over the past decades, girl groups have been an integral part of the music industry, exerting a profound influence on the musical landscape and creating timeless hits. Today, their presence has grown exponentially, with a staggering number of over six hundred girl groups thriving worldwide.

    <p>The term "girl group" also denotes the wave of American female pop singing groups who flourished in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

    <p>Girl Bands find their origins in different historical periods. However, the peak of girl band creation is clearly at the very beginning of the 90s. During this time, a significant number of Girl Bands emerged, with many of them typically featuring a three-member lineup.

<h3 class="w3-text-light-grey">Methodology: Melody, Wikidata, Data Sources - Challenges</h3>
<hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
<h4 class="w3-text-light-grey">Melody</h4>
<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The graphics of Melody is easy to understand and it is aesthetic</li>
  <li>The fact that it is possible to see the queries even if the story is published and visible to anyone is useful - it would be even better if it would be possible to see them for everything in the story (ex. Map, counter, etc.) </li>
  <li>Possibility of creating very rich and detailed tables</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>As a group, we found it difficult to work on Melody stories, as we could only work from one account on a single computer. It could be useful to work on the same story or project from different devices all together.</li>
  <li>It would be useful if we could save the project when we are working on it without publishing it, since sometimes it takes a lot to be saved and to see the latest uploaded version.</li>
  <li>Some bugs: when we used the arrows to move the items up and down, they often got deleted. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4 class="w3-text-light-grey">Wikidata</h4>
<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul>
 <li>Some items are easy to find and have a useful list of properties associated with them;</li>
 <li>The colors in the wikidata syntax are very useful for distinguishing the labels, the optional items and the items.</li>
 <li>Wikidata offers you many examples in different languages, through which it is possible to find some useful properties and items.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>It was not easy to find results. Even if the queries were correct, the corpus didn’t have enough results or sources in order to give us numbers that were useful. </li>
  <li>We had difficulties sometimes to find the correct queries. Ex “singer” gave us problems, and we used “musician” even if it is a more general and broader category.</li>
  <li>Wikidata signals when you make a mistake in the query, however it does not specify the error. </li>
  <li>Difficulty in finding the right properties, for example in distinguishing between P27 (country of citizenship), P276 (location), P495 (from), P19/P131* (resident in the territorial entity of), and the ones for the authorship of the songs, which ended up being “lyrics by”, P676, and not “is the author of” or “written by”. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4 class="w3-text-light-grey">Data Sources</h4>
<p>We started by doing some searches on the Polifonia corpus with the MusicBo module. However, we could not find much information about the artists we had in mind to analyze. MusicBo offers much data about music in Bologna and classical music in general, however, it was not possible to retrieve information about music in the world, so we opted for the Wikidata knowledge graph in general. MusicBo was useful for doing our first researches.</p>
